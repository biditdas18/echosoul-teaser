# EchoSoul 🔒 (In Development)

> *“A recommender engine for the inner self.”*

EchoSoul is a private emotional recommender project currently under active development by [@biditdas18](https://github.com/biditdas18).  
It captures the soul’s emotional resonance and recommends music, memories, and meaning — all in harmony with who you truly are.

### 🔒 Current Status

This project is being incubated privately for now, with a planned public launch later in 2025.

You can track my commit activity [here](https://github.com/biditdas18) as I build EchoSoul in stealth mode.

### 💡 Vision

EchoSoul is not just another music engine. It's a **mirror for your emotional world** — built on the idea that recommendations should connect with how you *feel*, not just what you've clicked.

Stay tuned for more.
